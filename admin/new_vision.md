# The Perfect Lap: Predicting Optimal Pit Stops for Race Success

## Primary Stakeholder
- **Race Engineers:** The strategists who guide drivers during a race and decide when to pit. Their decisions are made under intense time pressure, and a single lap can determine whether a driver wins or loses.

## Secondary Stakeholders
- **Drivers:** They depend on the timing of pit calls for their performance and race outcome.
- **Formula 1 Teams:** Teams can use insights from predictive models to refine long-term strategy.
- **Fans & Commentators:** Gain a clearer understanding of how pit stop timing shapes the race.

## Problem Statement
In Formula 1, the timing of a pit stop is one of the most critical factors in determining race outcomes. Teams rely on experience, simulations, and live race data to make these calls, yet even a small timing mistake can cause a major loss. Existing research often frames the decision as a binary “pit now or not,” or uses simplified predictions of finishing position. What’s missing is a tool that **identifies the specific lap** that offers the greatest strategic advantage.

## Solution
We will build a machine-learning model that predicts the **optimal lap** for a pit stop—the lap where stopping gives the highest chance of success. By shifting from a yes/no decision to **exact lap recommendations**, our project goes further than prior work. It will help race engineers make smarter, faster calls while also showing fans how pit stop timing can change the course of a race.
